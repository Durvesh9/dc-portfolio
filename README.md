 Durvesh Chaudhari - Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases my journey and skills in web development, particularly my transition from basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to building a React-based version of my portfolio.

 Live Demo

Hosted on Netlify: https://durvesh-portfolio.netlify.app/

 About the Project

This portfolio site serves as both an introduction to my work and a hands-on learning project for understanding the fundamentals of React. 

1. Version 1 - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:  
   The original version of this portfolio was built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my web development skills, demonstrates responsive design, and emphasizes the structure and layout of a professional portfolio website.

2. Version 2 - React Clone:  
   I created a clone of this portfolio using React to grasp the basics of building a single-page application. Rebuilding it in React helped me understand component-based architecture, state management, and routing.

 Features

- Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes to provide a smooth user experience on desktop and mobile devices.
- Interactive Elements: Leveraged JavaScript for interactive components like buttons and smooth scrolling.
- React Version: Reconstructed with React to reinforce my knowledge of component-based development and enhance interactivity.

 Technologies Used

- HTML & CSS: Structuring and styling the content of the website.
- JavaScript: Adding interactivity and dynamic elements to the site.
- React: Cloning the portfolio to understand component-driven development and the fundamentals of React.

 Key Learnings

- HTML & CSS Fundamentals: Gained confidence in structuring web pages and styling with CSS for clean, responsive designs.
- JavaScript: Enhanced my understanding of DOM manipulation and user interaction handling.
- React Basics: Rebuilding this site as a React app taught me about components, JSX, props, state, and the advantages of a single-page application framework.
